The Porter Forces are a model developed by Michael Porter to analyze the competitive environment of a business. It consists of five elements: threat of new entrants, threat of substitutes, bargaining power of buyers, bargaining power of suppliers, and rivalry among existing competitors. The threat of new entrants looks at the difficulty a new company would have in entering the market and competing with existing businesses. The threat of substitutes looks at whether there are alternative products or services that could be chosen instead of the company's product or service. The bargaining power of buyers looks at how much power customers have to negotiate prices and terms. The bargaining power of suppliers looks at how much power suppliers have to negotiate prices and terms. Finally, the rivalry among existing competitors looks at how intense the competition is between existing businesses. By analyzing these five elements, businesses can better understand their competitive environment and make informed decisions about how to position themselves in the market.
